# Text-Adventure-Game

I'm currently developing a text adventure game in order to train my skills in JavaScript, CSS and HTML5. It's fun to do and it allows you to do some creative writing as well. Users can select only one option. There are various choices which lead to different outcomes of the game. A first version of my game "The Tale of the Surprise Encounter" is currently online.
